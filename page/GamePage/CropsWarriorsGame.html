					During the exploration they will encounter ennemis. They will become stronger be killing them and looting news weapons.</p>

			    <h2>My work</h2>
                <p>I worked on two majors things: weapons system and ennemies. We needed differents types of weapons with a lot of settings.
					Each of them should be unique in theirs effects and utility.
					The second thing is the differents types of ennemis. Theirs comportements (IA) and theirs interactions with the
					weapons.					</p>

                <h2>● Weapon</h2>

                <p>I was in charge of the weapon system. The player must be able to pick a weapon on the ground and to attack with it,
				 it should work with <Strong>any</strong> weapon. We wanted a wide a range of weapon: gun, shotgun, laser,... I sorted out my problematic:
				<strong>How i do a well-constructed code to make weapon easily?</strong></p>

                        <h3>Steps 1: Type of weapon</h3>
						<p>I established all the weapon type needed.</p>
                        <p>- Gun</p>
                        <p>- Laser </p>

                        <h3>Steps 2: create an architecture: clear and simple architecture of a lot of differents weapons</h3>
                        <p>First of all, I have made a list of function and parameter for each type of weapon.</p>
                        <p>A lot of these function and parameter are commun between several types.
						I established an architecture based on these communs points.</p>
                        <p>At the root we have mom-class with all commun fonction(recharge, shoot,...) and parameter(attack speed, damage,..)
						for the gun. Derived from that the type(melee,throw,gun) and the archetype of these type. For example laserGun, chargeGun,... for type Gun.  </p>

                    <div class="gif-info">
                        <h3>Steps 3: create a tools: easy access to creation and modification of a weapon</h3>
                        <p>To facilitate the modification and creation of a weapon I use scriptable object contening the data.</p>
                        <p>This way, game disagner or other don't need to enter in the script, its all in inspector.  </p>
                        <p>They can modify them when they want and experiment, it's easy and quick. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
				
				<h3>Steps 4: Special weapon: how to include in the architecture? </h3>
                <p>To produce a special weapon i take the clostest type in the architecture and i check where the difference will be. If the modification is on the weapon
				itself or if is the effect of a munition it won't be the same changement. Most of the special weapon need to be make one by one
				, it take a lot of time.</p>
				

                <h2>● Ennemies</h2>

                <p>The ennemies and the weapon are the core gameplay of our game. They need constant work, they evolve a lot with the project and with the interaction between them. 
				They are only 3 types of ennemies: Basic, Flying, Big. Some of them don't react the same way to certain weapon.
				<strong>So i was wondering how to do a modulaire architecture for the different type of ennemis?</strong></p>

                        <h3>Steps 1 :Commun Architecture: Simple model of ennemies</h3>
                        <p>Since they will be several ennemis I wanted to have a commun Architecture, this ways it easier to uniforme the effect of weapon and the global comportment of ennemis. </p>
                        <p>I have defined 4 states, mouvement, attack, death, nothing. All of the ennemis have these but the effect can be different. 
						In addition we need to organize the information reseaux, who communic what with who. </p>

                        <p>These two types of ennemies are very similar. Their pattern are of attack and movement are the same, only their stats and the effect of some weapon change.</p>
                        <p>Movement: they choose the nearest target (player) and go the them by using a navmesh. When they are close enough the switch to attack.</p>
						<p>Attack: if close enough of an target they hit him by a small charge.</p>

                        <h3>Steps 3: Flying ennemies: ennemies without navmesh</h3>
						<p>Is comportment is very different from the other two ennemies. It need the attack at distance and to be high enough
							to not be able to be hit by normal mean. Only special weapon can hit or player should grab an allies to gain height.</p>
                        <p>Movement: It not use any navmesh, it use raycast vertical and horizontal. Vertical to check the distance to the ground 
						to keep a good height, and horizontal to detect obstacle in front of him if that the case he gain height.</p>
						<p>Attack: when a good enough distance he fire projectile toward player. It also take care to check the height ton be able to be hit.</p>
